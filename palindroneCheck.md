## Recursion

## Iteratively with a pointer

## Recursion
Acknolwedge that recursion might required additional memory usage because of the call stack. 

Also bring up tail recursion - tail recursive functions are considered better than non tail recursive functions as tail-recursion can be optimized by compiler. The idea used by compilers to optimize tail-recursive functions is simple, since the recursive call is the last statement, there is nothing left to do in the current function, so saving the current functionâ€™s stack frame is of no use.

# Creating a new string
Space: O(n)
Time: O(n^2)

Strings are immutable. On each concatenation a new copy of the string is created, so that the overall complexity is O(n^2). The iteration is O(n) and the inner concatenation is O(n) leading to O(n^2).

To say that runtime is O(1) means that there is a constant c such that the runtime is bounded above by c, independent of the input. It doesn't mean that it takes constant time (runtime or number of operations).
